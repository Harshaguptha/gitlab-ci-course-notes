This course notes have been created for the students of the "Gitlab CI: Pipelines, CI/CD and DevOps for Beginners" online course on Udemy. If you are not a student yet, consider registering so that you can take full advantages of this material.

It is an additional material for the students that prefer to take notes. You can easily print the entire course content. 

I did my best to put this together, but it is not perfect. If you spot any spelling mistakes or would like to contribute and make this better, feel free to send me a Pull Request on github.com

Enjoy!
